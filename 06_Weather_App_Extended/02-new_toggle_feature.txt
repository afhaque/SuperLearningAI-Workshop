## New Feature Plan 

I would like to add a small toggle feature on the bottom right of the page that allows the user to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This should be a floating button that remains in the bottom right. 

Explain to me the general approach we should take in implementing the feature. 

Call out the specific files that will need to be changed.
