## Node Primer
Create a primer for me on node.js. Explain to me what node is, what it is used for, and what it is not. Include a summarized explanation of its basic syntax and common commands. Use comparisons to Python to help me understand the differences. I am a python developer who has not written javascript code nor am I familiar with node.js.
